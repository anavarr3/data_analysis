1. What is a Facility ID?,,,,
,,,,
This is a unique identification number that has been given to each facility subject to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The identification number can be used to track a facility's emissions totals from one year to the next should the facility's name or address change.,,,,
,,,,
2. What is an FRS ID?,,,,
,,,,
"An FRS ID (Facility Registry System Identification Number) is a facility identification number. The Facility Registry System is a centrally managed EPA database that identifies facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest across various EPA programs.",,,,
,,,,
3. What is a NAICS Code?,,,,
,,,,
"NAICS code stands for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. It is a six-digit code that represents the product, activity, or service at a facility or supplier. The codes are listed in the Federal Register and defined in “North American Industrial Classification System Manual 2007,” available from the U.S. Department of Commerce at http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/.",,,,
,,,,
4. How are biogenic CO2 emissions accounted for in facility totals?,,,,
,,,,
"Facilities that burn biogenic materials such as wood are required to report total GHG emissions associated with the combustion of those biogenic materials. This file contains the total biogenic CO2 emissions reported by each facility. Biogenic emissions are NOT included in the facility's total emissions or in the total emissions by process. Biogenic emissions were most commonly reported by electricity generation units, pulp and paper mills, landfills and other facilities combusting large amounts of fuel.",,,,
,,,,
5. How do the total emissions from each industry type/subpart differ from the industry totals presented on the data dashboard in FLIGHT?,,,,
,,,,
"The sum of total emissions from facilities that report under a particular process (subpart) may differ from the industry totals presented in the data dashboard in FLIGHT for certain industry types. EPA calculates the sector totals displayed in the data dashboard by summing the total emissions reported under the process of interest, and then adding in any emissions from stationary combustion (Subpart C) reported by facilities of that type. When 3 or more subparts for any one facility are reported, there are additional considerations that determine how the emissions are split and recorded. Certain industry types on the data dashboard only include emissions reported from fossil fuel combustion under Subpart C. Total emissions for these industry types are determined by summing all Subpart C emissions reported by facilities with the relevant NAICS code. For more information on how EPA calculated sector totals please view the following pages in our help content: http://www.ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=93290546 , http://www.ccdsupport.com/confluence/display/ghgp/Understanding+Facility+Types , http://www.ccdsupport.com/confluence/display/ghgp/Calculating+GHG+Totals+by+Industry .",,,,
,,,,
6. What's the difference between a 'direct emitter' and a 'supplier'?,,,,
,,,,
"The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) data and other relevant information from large emissions sources and suppliers of certain products in the United States. 

Direct emitters are required to report total GHG emissions that take place at their facility from the processes covered by the program. Suppliers of fossil fuel products such as petroleum, natural gas, and industrial gases report the total GHG quantity that would result from the complete combustion, oxidation or use of the covered products they supply to the economy.",,,,
,,,,
7. Why are the GHG quantities for some suppliers labeled as 'confidential'?,,,,
,,,,
"A reporter's total supplier level CO2e is confidential business information (CBI) if the reporter produces, imports, exports or otherwise supplies just one product and if EPA has determined that the amount of that one product produced, imported, exported or otherwise supplied is CBI.",,,,
,,,,
8. What types of facilities are associated with CO2 Injection?,,,,
,,,,
"As part of the GHGRP, EPA issued a final rule that requires facilities that conduct geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Subpart RR) and all other facilities that inject CO2 underground for any other reason (Subpart UU) to report greenhouse gas (GHG) data to EPA annually. Subpart RR includes facilities that conduct geologic sequestration by injecting CO2 for long-term containment in subsurface geologic formations, including facilities with wells permitted as Underground Injection Control (UIC), Class VI. All other facilities that inject a CO2 underground for any reason, including enhanced oil and gas recovery and acid gas disposal facilities must report basic information on CO2 received for injection under Subpart UU. The quantity of CO2 received for injection injected by each reporter is confidential except for facilities with an EPA-approved subpart RR R&D project exemption for greenhouse gas reporting of geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.  For more information on these subparts see: https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/resources-subpart-ghg-reporting.",,,,
,,,,
9. What do facilities engaged in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting report for their address?,,,,
,,,,
"Facilities engaged in onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting report aggregated emissions at the basin level. Because of the large geographic size of the basins, these reporters may use the address of the U.S. corporate headquarters, including its street address, city, state, and zip code.  To ensure that multiple facilities that share the same corporate address can be uniquely identified, EPA asks reporters to specify the code and name of the basin as identified by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (e.g., MLH Production Inc. 470 Fort Worth Syncline) in the facility name. As a result, the address, city and state associated with these reporters will not necessarily be in close proximity to the location where reported emissions occur.",,,,
,,,,
"10. What information is available through Envirofacts, FLIGHT, the Data Highlights Website and the downloadable data files?",,,,
,,,,
EPA has several data portals through which the public can access data collected by the GHGRP. A description of each portal including the types of queries that can be performed using each one is available here: https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghg-reporting-program-data-sets.,,,,
,,,,
"11. Why are oil and gas - onshore production facilities, oil and gas - gathering and boosting, oil and gas - transmission pipelines, oil and gas - local distribution company direct emissions and facilities emitting SF6 from use in electrical equipment not included with other direct emitters?",,,,
,,,,
"These type of facilities are not traditional point sources of GHGs. Onshore oil and natural gas producers and gathering and boosting facilities report the total GHG emissions from their operations within unique basins defined by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  Transmission pipelines report aggregated pipeline blowdown GHG emissions nationally (and for each state) in which they operate. Local distribution companies report the total GHG emissions that take place over their entire distribution system, within a state. Facilities reporting SF6 emissions from electrical equipment use report the total emissions from electrical transmission and distribution equipment over broad spatial areas. Because some of these facilities can span state lines or encompass a broad geographic area, it would not be appropriate to include them in the list with other direct emitters whose emissions can be attributed to a specific address. For facilities that are both direct emitters and one of these 5 types, the reported direct emissions are included in the direct emitters tab and the other emissions on the appropriate tab. Reported emissions are not double counted. See this FAQ for more information about the facility definition for facilities in the petroleum and natural gas systems sector: http://www.ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=189038689. ",,,,
,,,,
12. What are the global warming potentials (GWPs) used in publication of GHGRP data?,,,,
,,,,
"Effective reporting year 2013, the GHGRP updated many of the GWP values used to calculate reporters’ emissions in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). These GWP values were updated from values provided in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (SAR) to those in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR-4). See Table A-1 for the complete list of gases and their updated GWPs. To present a consistent time-series, EPA has provided re-calculated prior year GHG totals, which were calculated using SAR values, using the revised AR4 GWP values. The raw data submitted by facilities for reporting years prior to 2013 remains as submitted using SAR GWPs.",,,,
,,,,
13. Why does this file not include data reported for 2010? Where can I access this information?,,,,
,,,,
"This file contains reported GHG data by facilities and suppliers from 2011 through the most recent data year. Reported emissions from 2010 are not included because data for some facilities are not directly comparable between 2010 and subsequent years. In 2010, facilities were required to report emissions from 29 source categories (listed here: http://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=189038660).  Emissions from an additional 12 source categories (listed here:  http://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=141983788) began to be reported in 2011. Therefore, the total reported emissions for many facilities increased from 2010 to 2011 because new emissions sources were reported for the first time.

Users can obtain 2010 data for facilities of interest through FLIGHT, Envirofacts or by going to the GHGRP Data Sets Page (http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghgdata/reportingdatasets.html), clicking on the 2010 tab, and downloading the file Summary GHG Data file for that year. ",,,,
,,,,
14. What factors could have influenced facility-level greenhouse gas trends?,,,,
,,,,
"In general, observed trends in greenhouse gas totals presented in GHGRP data are due to changes in data reported by facilities. However, for chemical pulp and paper mills (subpart AA) and suppliers of natural gas and natural gas liquids (subpart NN), changes to methods facilities use to determine their greenhouse gas data has had an impact on observed trends. 

Visit these FAQ pages to learn more about changes in each of these industries.
- Subpart AA - http://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=247201865
- Subpart NN - http://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=247201863

EPA has corrected for a change in the GWPs used by reporters to determine their GHG quantities, which provides a consistent time series for all years of data reported to the GHGRP. Visit the following page to learn more: ",,,,
